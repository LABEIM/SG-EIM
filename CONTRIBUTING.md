## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Issues & Bugs

If you discover an issue, defect, or unexpected behavior:
1. Check the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/LABEIM/[REPOSITORY-NAME]/issues) to ensure the bug hasn't already been reported.
2. If unresolved, create a new issue using a concise, descriptive title.
3. Provide essential details:
   - **Description**: A clear summary of the unexpected behavior.
   - **Reproduction Steps**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug.
   - **Expected Behavior**: What you expected to happen.
   - **Environment**: OS, browser/runtime version, and hardware platform (if relevant).
   - **Logs / Screenshots**: Stack traces, error outputs, or screenshots.

### Requesting New Features

We welcome proposals for new features and optimizations:
1. Open a feature request in the issue tracker.
2. Describe the problem your proposal solves, target use cases, and suggested implementation approaches.
3. Discuss architectural implications with maintainers before opening large Pull Requests.

### Improving Documentation

High-quality documentation is vital for research and production software:
- Clarifying setup instructions, API references, architecture guides, and tutorial examples is always encouraged.
- Fix typos, broken links, or ambiguous explanations.

### Submitting Code Changes

Whether you are fixing a bug or adding a new feature, follow the git workflow detailed below.

---

## Getting Started & Local Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required runtimes and tools installed on your development machine:
- **Git** (latest stable)
- **Runtime / Package Manager**: `[e.g. Node.js >= 20.x, pnpm / npm / bun / Python >= 3.11 / Go >= 1.22]`
- **Editor**: VS Code, Cursor, or your preferred IDE

### Installation & Development Server

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LABEIM/[REPOSITORY-NAME].git
   cd [REPOSITORY-NAME]
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   [INSTALL_COMMAND / e.g. npm install]
   ```

3. **Start the local development server:**
   ```bash
   [DEV_SERVER_COMMAND / e.g. npm run dev]
   ```

4. **Verify baseline build and tests:**
   ```bash
   [LINT_COMMAND / e.g. npm run lint]
   [TEST_COMMAND / e.g. npm test]
   [BUILD_COMMAND / e.g. npm run build]
   ```

## Git & Contribution Workflow

### Branch Naming Standard

Always create a new feature or fix branch from `[MAIN_BRANCH / main]`. Do not commit directly to `[MAIN_BRANCH]`.

```text
feat/add-sensor-telemetry-endpoint
fix/auth-token-refresh-leak
docs/update-api-reference
perf/optimize-query-caching
refactor/modularize-router-handler
chore/bump-dependencies
```

**Common Branch Prefixes:**
| Prefix | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `feat/` | New feature, component, or functional capability |
| `fix/` | Bug fix or issue resolution |
| `docs/` | Documentation additions or adjustments |
| `perf/` | Performance optimizations |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring with no behavior change |
| `test/` | Adding or updating unit/integration tests |
| `chore/` | Tooling, dependencies, or repository maintenance |

### Commit Message Conventions

We strictly enforce the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```text
<type>(<optional scope>): <imperative description>

[optional body explaining WHY the change was made]

[optional footer(s), e.g. Closes #123]
```

**Valid commit types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`.

**Examples:**
```text
feat(auth): implement oauth2 token rotation
fix(api): handle null payload gracefully in webhook handler
docs(readme): add environment variables reference table
test(telemetry): add unit tests for packet parsing
```

### Commit Signing

Signed commits using GPG or SSH keys are strongly encouraged across all EIM Lab repositories to verify authorship:

```bash
git commit -S -m "feat(telemetry): add batch metrics processor"
```

## Pull Request (PR) Lifecycle

### PR Submission Checklist

Before submitting your Pull Request, ensure:
- [ ] Code compiles and passes all checks (`[LINT_COMMAND]`, `[BUILD_COMMAND]`).
- [ ] Automated tests pass successfully (`[TEST_COMMAND]`).
- [ ] New functionality includes corresponding unit or integration tests.
- [ ] Documentation (`README.md`, API specs, comments) is updated to reflect changes.
- [ ] Commit history is clean, signed, and adheres to Conventional Commits.
- [ ] Branch is rebased onto the latest `[MAIN_BRANCH]` branch with no merge conflicts.

### CI/CD Verification

Once your PR is opened:
1. Automated CI/CD pipelines will execute build, lint, and test suites.
2. If integrated with Cloudflare Pages or Vercel, a preview deployment will be generated for visual verification.
3. Ensure all CI checks pass green before requesting maintainer review.

### Code Review Process

- Project maintainers will review your PR for architectural alignment, code quality, test coverage, and security.
- Maintainers may request modifications or suggest improvements.
- Once approved, your PR will be merged into `[MAIN_BRANCH]`.

## Coding Standards & Quality Assurance

- **Code Formatting & Style:** Maintain consistent formatting by adhering to [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) (UTF-8, LF line endings, 2-space indentation).
- **Readability & Modularity:** Write clear, self-documenting code with descriptive naming and minimal cognitive complexity.
- **Type Safety:** Ensure strong typing (e.g. TypeScript, Zod, Python type hints) across data boundaries and API interfaces.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully catch and handle unexpected exceptions with helpful diagnostic log context.
- **Security Best Practices:** Never commit credentials, API keys, private tokens, or secrets. Use `.env.example` templates for configuration references.

---

## Security Vulnerability Disclosures

If you discover a security vulnerability or sensitive exploit:
- **Do not open a public GitHub issue, discussion, or PR.**
- Review our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for full reporting procedures and response guidelines.
- Report the vulnerability privately via email to: [`[CONTACT_EMAIL / lab@eimlab.org]`](mailto:[CONTACT_EMAIL]).
- Include full technical details and steps to reproduce. We will coordinate a patched release promptly.
